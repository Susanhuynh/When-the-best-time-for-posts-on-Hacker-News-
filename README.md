EXPLORE HACKER NEWS POSTS**

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

**Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?**
